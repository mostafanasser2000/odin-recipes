    <h2>Instructions</h2>


    <strong>
        <em>Tomato Sauce</em>
    </strong>
    <ol id="sauce">
        <li>Prepare your crushed tomatoes by blending 2 cans of tomatoes or 1kg of tomatoes in a blender</li>
        <li>Melt your butter in a stainless steel pot over a high heat, and add your large diced onions
        </li>
        <li>Cook for a few minutes until the onions turn translucent
        </li>
        <li>Add your crushed tomatoes to the pot and stir
        </li>
        <li>Add in 1 1/2 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp pepper and mix
        </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and then cover with a lid, leaving it slightly ajar
        </li>
        <li>Leave to simmer for 45 minutes on a medium to low heat
        </li>
        <li>Sauce is ready when reduced to a third of original amount
        </li>

    </ol>

    <strong>
        <em>Bechamel</em>
    </strong>
    <ol id="bechamel">
        <li>In a large non-stick pot melt all of your butter on a high heat
        </li>
        <li>When melted add all of your flour and mix until all the butter has been absorbed
        </li>
        <li>You are looking to form a wet dough that clumps together, if your mixture is looking too dry add more
            butter, if too dry add more flour.
        </li>

        <li>Cook your dough for around 5 minutes until it starts to resemble wet sand
        </li>
        <li>Start adding your milk 150ml at a time, add the milk and mix it in to the dough until fully combined
        </li>
        <li>Keep adding your milk in batches of 150ml until you have mixed all the milk into the dough. You should be
            left with a
            thick bechamel. If your mixture is too doughy or dry, add more milk a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Add your salt and pepper as well as a few small grates of nutmeg. Leave to cool before using.
        </li>


    </ol>
    <strong>

    </strong>
    <ol id="meat">
        <li>Add oil or butter to a pan on high heat and crush your garlic clove into it
        </li>
        <li>After 30 seconds add your onions, salt, and pepper then stir
        </li>
        <li>Cook your onions for around 5 minutes until cooked through and move to one side of the pan
        </li>
        <li>Add your minced beef to the empty part of the pan, pushing it down so it has good contact with the pan
        </li>
        <li>Cook your beef for around 3 minutes then flip
        </li>
        <li>After 3 more minutes break up your beef into small chunks using a wooden spoon
        </li>
        <li>Stir the onions into the beef and cook for a further 5 minutes until brown and cooked through
        </li>

        </li>
